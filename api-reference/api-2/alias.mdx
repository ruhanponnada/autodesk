title: Welcome to the Alias API
description: The API provides developers with access to Alias internal data and functionality through two products, OpenModel and OpenAlias.
---

OpenModel (OM) provides a programmer’s interface to the Alias wire file (our proprietary data files).
OpenAlias (OA) provides a programmer’s interface to the Alias application.
The API is written in C++ and is supplied as C++ classes. Most of the discussion in this document is intended for C++ programmers, and we assume that you understand the C++ concepts of classes and inheritance, and have a familiarity with the Alias interactive software.

### The components of the API are:

- Class descriptions and documentation for all classes and their methods
- The OpenModel shared libraries (.dlls and stub .libs): alias_api, api_image and api_memory and additionally the Alias shared libraries that the API libraries depend on.
- OpenAlias shared libraries (.so)
- The API header files
- Example plug-in programs in C++ for OpenAlias and OpenModel

<Tip>
It is important that you read the API-specific release notes to learn what changes have occurred in the API since the last release.
