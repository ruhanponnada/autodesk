We will use the following components of the platform:
- [Authentication](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview/)
- [Data Management](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview/)
- [Model Derivative](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview/)
- [Viewer](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview/)

<Tip>
If you're not interested in building the application from scratch, and you just want to try and run it locally, the complete implementation is available on GitHub:

For Node.js: https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-simple-viewer-nodejs
For .NET: https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-simple-viewer-dotnet
